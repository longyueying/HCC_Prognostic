# Data Preparation:
Use gdc_manifest.2020-01-03.txt to download WSI from TCGA dataset.
Use the download tool 'gdc-client' to download data. Run the command:
gdc-client download -m gdc_manifest.2020-01-03.txt -d ./data/svs/

# Classification network:
## Data Preprocess:
Run python ./data_preprocess/cls/make_slide_cuting.py to generate the thumbnail.
Run python ./data_preprocess/cls/make_tissue_mask.py to generate the tissue mask.
Run python ./data_preprocess/cls/make_lab_mask.py and python ./data_preprocess/cls/make_other_mask.py to generate Tumor,
Liver, Stroma and Hemorrhage & Necrosis mask.
Run python ./data_preprocess/cls/create_patch.py to obtain patches.

Training data should be a dictionary stored to disk containing the following keys set in ./configs/resnet18_tcga.json:
"data_path_40": the path to store tiled slides in non-overlapping 768x768 pixel windows at a magnification of 40x
"json_path_train":the path to store the training json containing the dictionary of a list of tuple (x,y) coordinates. 
"json_path_valid":the path to store the valid json containing the dictionary of a list of tuple (x,y) coordinates. 
Valid data should contain the slides and masks of the foreground area for each slide.

## Classification network training:
To train a model, use script ./Classification/bin/train_tcga.py. Run python ./Classification/bin/train_tcga.py -h to get help regarding input parameters.
The data path and label path are set in ./configs/resnet18_tcga.json (data_path_40,  json_path_train, json_path_valid).

## Classification network valid: 
To run a model on test set use script ./Classification/bin/probs_map.py. Run python ./Classification/bin/probs_map.py -h to get help regarding input parameters.
Script outputs: Segmentation mask maps of different tissues for each slide.

# Prognostic network:
## Data Sample:
Sample patches from slides according to the segmentation mask maps generated by Classification network.
Use ./data_preprocess/prognostic/sample_patch_x4.py, ./data_preprocess/prognostic/sample_patch_x10.py,
./data_preprocess/prognostic/sample_patch_x40.py to generate 40x, 10x, and 4x patches.

## Prognostic network training:
To train the prognostic network, use script ./Prognositic/bin/train.py. Run python  ./Prognositic/bin/train.py -h for help regarding input parameters.

## Prognostic network valid:
To run a model on a test set, use script ./Prognositic/vis/vis_save.py. Run python  ./Prognositic/vis/vis_save.py -h for help regarding input parameters.
## Script outputs:
.csv file with TRS(tumor risk score), patients' OS, outcome, patient ID.
To generate heatmap , use script ./Prognositic/vis/vis_save_1.py. Run python  ./Prognositic/vis/vis_save_1.py -h for help regarding input parameters.
